## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Workflow
We utilized an industry-standard data pipeline to ensure robust data integrity and visualization:

1.  **Python:** For advanced data cleaning, imputation (category-specific medians), and feature engineering (age binning).
2.  **MS SQL:** For implementing complex business logic, CTEs, and behavior-based customer segmentation.
3.  **Power BI:** For building the final interactive "Visual Command Center" to track real-time intelligence.
