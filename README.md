# Sales Performance Analytics

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics project focused on understanding consumer buying patterns. [cite_start]The analysis utilizes a dataset of 3,900 transactions to identify trends in expenditure, customer segmentation, and product performance[cite: 3, 4].

## Project Overview
[cite_start]The primary objective of this research is to examine transactional information across various product classes to inform business planning and strategic decision-making[cite: 3, 4]. The project follows a robust data pipeline:
* [cite_start]**Data Cleaning & Pre-processing:** Python (pandas) [cite: 56]
* [cite_start]**Complex Business Logic:** MS SQL [cite: 58]
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization:** Power BI [cite: 60]

## Dataset Summary
* [cite_start]**Total Entries:** 3,900 [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Total Fields:** 18 [cite: 7]
* [cite_start]**Key Variables:** Customer demographics (age, gender, location), transaction specifics (item type, category, cost, season), and purchasing metrics (discount usage, past transactions, frequency)[cite: 9, 10, 11].

## Key Insights & Analysis

### 1. Customer Segmentation
[cite_start]Customers were classified into three strategic segments based on their purchase history[cite: 34]:
* [cite_start]**Loyal (3,116 customers):** The core stability of the business with high recurring purchase history[cite: 96, 97].
* [cite_start]**Returning (701 customers):** Moderate engagement with potential for loyalty conversion[cite: 98, 99].
* [cite_start]**New (83 customers):** Latest cohort requiring specific onboarding and retention strategies[cite: 100, 101].

### 2. Demographic Performance
* [cite_start]**Gender:** Male customers contribute approximately **$157,890** in revenue, which is roughly **2.1x** the revenue generated by female segments ($75,191)[cite: 28, 72].
* [cite_start]**Age Groups:** Revenue peaks in the **Young Adult** demographic ($62.1k) and shows a marginal decline as customer age increases[cite: 74, 75].

### 3. Subscription & Loyalty
* [cite_start]**Subscription Status:** Only **27%** of customers are active subscribers[cite: 77, 79].
* [cite_start]**Revenue Contribution:** Non-subscribers account for **73%** of revenue ($170k), representing a significant upside opportunity for membership conversion[cite: 76, 78].

### 4. Product Highlights
* [cite_start]**Top Sellers:** Jewelry (Accessories) and Blouse/Pants (Clothing) lead in order volume with **171 units** each[cite: 84, 85, 87, 88].
* [cite_start]**Top Rated:** Gloves and Sandals are among the highest-rated products with average scores of **3.86** and **3.84** respectively[cite: 30].

## Technical Implementation

### Data Cleaning (Python)
* [cite_start]Imputed 37 missing `Review Rating` values using category-specific medians[cite: 12, 17, 18].
* [cite_start]Standardized headers to `snake_case` for SQL compatibility[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]Feature engineering: Created `age_group` binning and calculated `purchase_frequency_days`[cite: 21, 22].

### SQL Analysis
[cite_start]Structured queries were performed to calculate revenue contributions, identify high-spending discount users, and rank products by category and rating[cite: 27, 29, 35].

### Power BI Dashboard
[cite_start]An interactive visual command center was built to allow stakeholders to filter intelligence by Category, Subscription Status, and Shipping Type[cite: 106, 108].

## Strategic Recommendations
* [cite_start]**Boost Subscriptions:** Promote exclusive benefits to convert the 73% non-subscriber pool[cite: 41, 111].
* [cite_start]**Loyalty Programs:** Implement rewards for frequent buyers to transition them into the "Loyal" segment[cite: 42, 113].
* [cite_start]**Targeted Marketing:** Focus campaigns on high-revenue segments (Young Adults) and top-rated products[cite: 43, 115].
* [cite_start]**Product Positioning:** Highlight category leaders like Jewelry and high-rated items in promotional efforts[cite: 45, 117].
